title: "Water Security for Canadian Indigenous [Problem-Finding Report]"
---

**Date:** 2019

**Summary:** This was a project done as part of the course Business and Design Thinking. Access to clean water is a rising threat in the world. But for the indigenous people in Canada, this has already been a decades-long issue. I did a report to map out the structural issues underneath the problem. Stakeholders relevant to this problem are also identified.
