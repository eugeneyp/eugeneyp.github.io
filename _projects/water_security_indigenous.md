title: "Water Security for Canadian Indigenous"
---

**Date:** 2019

**Summary:** This was a project I did for the course Business and Design Thinking in OCAD University's graduate program in Strategic Foresight and Innovation. 

Access to clean water is a rising threat in the world. But for the indigenous people in Canada, this has already been a decades-long issue. I did a problem-finding report to map out the structural issues underneath the problem. Stakeholders relevant to this problem were also identified. 

This was followed by a second project where I worked within a team to propose a solution for clean water access for Six Nations, one of the largest indigenous reserves out of Toronto.
