**Date: 2019**

**Summary:** This is a continuation of the problem-finding project "Water Security for Canadian Indigenous". We formed a team that focused on the clean water issue in Six Nations, one of the largest first nation reserves out of Toronto. We examined the structural issues and came up with one alternative proposal that uses decentralized water treatment technology. Business value and financial viability were analyzed, as well as budget and timeline. 

**Lessons Learned:**

- How to use the tools Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, financial calculation
