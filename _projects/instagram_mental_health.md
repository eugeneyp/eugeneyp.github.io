**Date:** 2020

**Summary**: This project was done within the courses Systems Thinking and Research Methods in the master's program Strategic Foresight and Innovation at OCAD University. The project investigated the impact of Instagram on the larger socio-technical system, and specifically its unhealthy effect on self-esteem. It mapped out the systemic inter-relationships and causal feedback loops that drive the problem.
