title: "RIIOT - Industrial IoT Wireless Connectivity Platform"
---

**Summary**

I moved to Norway for a love partnership and found a job in Radiocrafts, an IoT wireless company in Oslo. I was asked to design an IoT wireless platform for the launch of a new long-range wireless module that is suited for the industrial sector. The new platform is called RIIoT (Radiocrafts Industrial Internet of Things). 

Similar to my work with RapidConnect, I designed the platform API that is easy to use. I had significant input into the product. I wrote documentation and user guides, and tested the product performance. I also designed the data protocol for communication to the cloud. I worked with sales and marketing to prepare the product positioning and sales pitch.

**Lessons**

Creating a new product is messy. There are many ideas and inputs. The ambiguity and messiness just needs to be embraced. Yet at the same time, there must be a product leader who takes the practical steps to move the development forward and deliver iterations for feedback. It is not a straight linear path. Don't get stuck just in the visioning phase. Take concrete steps to define and deliver.
