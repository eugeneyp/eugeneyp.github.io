title: "Foresight-informed Agile for Resilient Product Strategy [Major Research Project]"
---

**Dates**: 2021

**Summary:** This was my final research project for my master's degree of Strategic Foresight and Innovation at OCAD University. The project investigated whether organizations that use the software development methodology of Agile are resilient to major disruptions. Through surveys and interviews with Agile product managers and industry experts, we found that Agile's short-term focus makes the organization vulnerable to disruptions at a magnitude that is beyond the ability of Agile to adapt. We proposed a new framework that complements Agile with Strategic Foresight to improve the strategic resilience of Agile organizations.

**My Role:** The project was done in partnership with a fellow graduate student researcher, Caitlin Pannell-Evans. Professor Nabil Harfoursh was our advisor.

**Problem and Objective:** 

**What Happened:**

- Literature review to understand context and background for problem
- Designed research with mix-method methodology
- Conducted interviews of Agile Product Managers
- Conducted interviews of experts
- Ran a survey to get input from Agile Product Managers
- Analyzed research data
- Designed a potential solution and framework

**Outcome:** 

- Final report and presentation on data findings and solution
- A proposed solution: Resilient Product Strategy Toolkit, which integrates Strategic Foresight with Agile to improve the strategic resilience for Agile teams and organizations.

**Challenges Encountered:**

- *How to narrow down the research question*: Nabil our advisor helped us to work through iterations of our research question until it is something that can be reasonably answered within the time and resource constraints of MRP
- *How to recruit participants*: PM's times are precious. We sent out survey to different membership groups and associations. But the most effective method was connecting with PMs 1 by 1 on linkedin. We crafted our recruiting messages to be more and more effective. It was just brute force and grinding to recruit people.
- *Complex data set*: The data was overwhelming. There were both quantitative and qualitative data. How do we sort through them? We went through it in multiple passes, noting our impressions and forming different questions with which to further probe the data set. With the qualitative data (interviews and survey responses), we identified themes. With the quantitative data, we ran correlation analysis. Finally, we weaved together all the data insights into 7 major findings
- *How to design a solution for resource-constrained small-to-medium organizations*: Most strategic foresight adoption literature focused on large corporations and public sector. It was a challenge on how to introduct Strategic Foresight to small-to-medium organizations who are more resource-constrained. Also important was being able to integrate to their existing Agile product management processes and culture.

**Lessons Learned:**

- Be willing to embrace the grind with the recruiting
  - Craft concise and appealing recruiting messages
  - Try to give value back to the participants and experts. Give appreciation and respect. Ask good questions that are valuable for them to reflect on. Loop back to share the research insights.

- Define the boundary of the project upfront
  - This is one of the most important steps early on. After having done a preliminary literature review, you should have a idea now on your research topic. Refine your research question through iterations, until it is something that you know you can answer within the constraints of the project. You'll be able to know what data you need, who you needs to reach out to, how to reach out to them, and whether it is possible within the time constraints. 
  - Focus on the primary research question to not get lost and sidetracked
  - Accept that the project does not need to answer everything. It is OK to have limitations.

- Be patient with the data analysis. The data set is ambiguous and complex. Go through multiple passes. Probe deeper by asking the data with different questions. Eventually a pattern will emerge for you to be able to tell a narrative.

- Embrace the ambiguity in the solution design. Start with sketches; discuss, brainstorm. Give yourself the space and time to be in the divergent phase before converging on a final solution.

- Tools and methodologies used: mixed-method (qualitiative and quantitative) research
