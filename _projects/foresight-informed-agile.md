title: "Foresight-informed Agile for Resilient Product Strategy [Major Research Project]"
---

**Dates**: 2021

**Summary:** This was my final research project for my master's degree of Strategic Foresight and Innovation at OCAD University. 

*Abstract*

Agile is today’s dominant operational framework in software product development due to its effectiveness at helping teams overcome dynamic and uncertain conditions. As external uncertainties increase, some organizations are also adopting Agile as a strategic approach. However, we hypothesize that while Agile contributes to adaptability, it is insufficient for an organization to be resilient against major disruptions.

This research project studies the relationship between Agile software development and the strategic resilience of small-to-medium-sized organizations in Ontario, Canada. Using a mix of surveys and interviews with product leaders, we found that many teams’ strategic capability to be resilient is limited due to Agile’s narrow attention and short-term focus, encouraging teams to be reactive rather than proactive.

We designed the Resilient Product Strategy Toolkit, which integrates proven Strategic Foresight practices with existing Agile and product management processes to help teams broaden their attention and increase their capability to manage uncertainty. This research design contributes to the plausibility of combining Agile and Strategic Foresight as an ambidextrous approach to enhance an organization’s strategic resilience.

**My Role:** The project was done in partnership with a fellow graduate student researcher, Caitlin Pannell-Evans. Professor Nabil Harfoursh was our advisor.	

**What we did:**

- Literature review to understand context and background for problem
- Designed research with mix-method methodology
- Conducted interviews of Agile Product Managers
- Conducted interviews of experts
- Ran a survey to get input from Agile Product Managers
- Analyzed research data
- Designed a potential solution and framework

**Outcome:** 

- Final report and presentation on data findings and solution
- A proposed solution: Resilient Product Strategy Toolkit, which integrates Strategic Foresight with Agile to improve the strategic resilience for Agile teams and organizations.

**Challenges Encountered:**

- *How to narrow down the research question*: Nabil our advisor helped us to work through iterations of our research question until it is something that can be reasonably answered within the time and resource constraints of MRP
- *How to recruit participants*: PM's times are precious. We sent out survey to different membership groups and associations. But the most effective method was connecting with PMs 1 by 1 on linkedin. We crafted our recruiting messages to be more and more effective. It was just brute force and grinding to recruit people.
- *Complex data set*: The data was overwhelming. There were both quantitative and qualitative data. How do we sort through them? We went through it in multiple passes, noting our impressions and forming different questions with which to further probe the data set. With the qualitative data (interviews and survey responses), we identified themes. With the quantitative data, we ran correlation analysis. Finally, we weaved together all the data insights into 7 major findings
- *How to design a solution for resource-constrained small-to-medium organizations*: Most strategic foresight adoption literature focused on large corporations and public sector. It was a challenge on how to introduct Strategic Foresight to small-to-medium organizations who are more resource-constrained. Also important was being able to integrate to their existing Agile product management processes and culture.

**Lessons Learned:**

- Be willing to embrace the grind with the recruiting
  - Craft concise and appealing recruiting messages
  - Try to give value back to the participants and experts. Give appreciation and respect. Ask good questions that are valuable for them to reflect on. Loop back to share the research insights.

- Define the boundary of the project upfront
  - This is one of the most important steps early on. After having done a preliminary literature review, you should have a idea now on your research topic. Refine your research question through iterations, until it is something that you know you can answer within the constraints of the project. You'll be able to know what data you need, who you needs to reach out to, how to reach out to them, and whether it is possible within the time constraints. 
  - Focus on the primary research question to not get lost and sidetracked
  - Accept that the project does not need to answer everything. It is OK to have limitations.

- Be patient with the data analysis. The data set is ambiguous and complex. Go through multiple passes. Probe deeper by asking the data with different questions. Eventually a pattern will emerge for you to be able to tell a narrative.

- Embrace the ambiguity in the solution design. Start with sketches; discuss, brainstorm. Give yourself the space and time to be in the divergent phase before converging on a final solution.

- Tools and methodologies used: mixed-method (qualitiative and quantitative) research

**Why I chose this topic**: There is an increasing gap between the increasing complexity of the world around us and our methodologies and ways of doing business. Agile evolved out of the need to tackle more complexity and uncertainty. But it's been more than two decades since the invention of Agile. I wanted to look at whether we need another evolution of our methodologies to be able to manage the new levels of complexity and uncertainty. 

**What were my main contributions**: Caitlin and I had a good partnership. I have better grasp of theory and concepts. She is more grounded and practical, good with working with constraints, and is a kick-ass designer. I also did the numerical analysis of data. I wrote most of the literature review to set the theoretical context. She did the design. We did almost all of the project side-by-side.

**What was most unexpected?** I didn't expect how synergestic Agile and Strategic Foresight are. They closely complement each other. It just made sense to integrate them together. I also didn't expect how generous our participants and experts were in giving their time and thoughtful responses.
