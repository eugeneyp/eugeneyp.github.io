I have a BASc in Mechatronics Engineering from University of Waterloo and a MDes in Strategic Foresight and Innovation from OCAD University. 

Mechatronics Engineering taught me the systems integration between mechanical, electrical, and software. After graduating, I joined a small technology startup that deliver solutions for Internet of Things communication. Being the first embedded engineer in the company, I designed our core product platforms from the ground up. 

It was a great opportunity to learn my way through different areas -- hardware, embedded firmware, software, cloud, and security. And as the company grew, I grew into managing engineering teams and customer relationships. I also participated in the editing and testing of industry standards for IoT communication

On the side, I explored human development and spirituality. I facilitated workshops on mindfulness, authentic relating, and Circling (a connection-building practice). I did trainings in team coaching through ORSC (organization relationships systems coaching). I participated in as many cutting-edge workshops on human development as I could find.

Then I woke up to the fact that our current system is unsustainable. So I enrolled into the Strategic Foresight and Innovation program at OCADU. Here I learned how to use futures thinking, systems thinking, and design thinking to tackle problems that are more complex than what conventional methods can solve. 

I am interested in how we can expand our conversations and to bring in all that we are — the different ways of seeing, thinking, and relating — to the complex challenges of our time.
