I started my career in small technology startups that deliver solutions for Internet of Things communication. Being one of the leading engineers, I learned my way through many things — hardware, embedded firmware, software, cloud, and security — to deliver innovative solutions to the market. Being in small companies also gave me the opportunity to take on many responsibilities: designing new solution platforms from the ground up, managing teams across disciplines, and managing customer relationships. 

My BASc was in Mechatronics Engineering from University of Waterloo, a multi-disciplinary program that integrated mechanical, electrical, software, and systems engineering. When I woke up to the wider challenges that we collectively face, I did a MDes in Strategic Foresight and Innovation from OCAD University, which uses futures thinking, systems thinking, and design thinking to tackle problems that are more complex than what conventional methods can solve.

On the side, I explored human development and spirituality through meditation, authentic relating and somatic-based therapy. I facilitated workshops on mindfulness, authentic relating, and Circling (a connection-building practice). I was trained in team coaching through ORSC (organization relationship systems coaching). I am also a student of Christian contemplative wisdom through the teacher Cynthia Bourgeault, and a student of Taijiquan (Tai Chi Chuan) through Sifu Adam Mizner at Heaven Man Earth. 

In summary, I bring a unique perspective that mixes experiences from Eastern and Western mindsets, modern engineering and ancient spirituality, rational individuated mind and embodied intimate relationships. 

I want to bring curiosity, courage, creativity, and most of all, connectedness in seeking new possibilities in how we can be resilient and sustainable in these complex and uncertain times.
