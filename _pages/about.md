I have a multi-disciplinary background in engineering management, strategic foresight and complex systems thinking. 

After graduating with a Bachelors of Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering from University of Waterloo, I joined an Internet of Things (IoT) startup as the lead embedded engineer. 

- Designed and developed the IoT communication platforms RapidConnect and RIIoT, which were used to integrate IoT wireless communication into hundreds of products and services. 
- Grew to managing teams, projects, and programs; delivering IoT solutions for Fortune 500 businesses
- Solving IoT problems by learning quickly at the intersection of software, hardware, firmware, network protocols, cloud, mobile, web, security, and user experience.

Then I completed a Master of Design in Strategic Foresight & Innovation, which applies complexity systems thinking, strategic foresight, and design thinking to tackle problems that are more complex than what typical business approaches can solve. Example projects I worked on:

- Winning the top award at the Association of Professional Futurists with a strategic foresight report for a civic non-profit
- Business and strategy consulting for an Inuit social enterprise
- Final research project: how to develop resilient product strategies by combining strategic foresight and agile methodology

And I care about people and team dynamics:

- Completed a program in Organization Relationship System Coaching (ORSC) on how to resolve conflicts
- Designed and facilitated a Mindfulness workshop for change leaders—how to be present to oneself and others
- Lived and worked across North America, Europe, and Asia—able to appreciate and value different perspectives
